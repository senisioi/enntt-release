The translated texts from different source languages represent a subset of the [Haifa Corpus of Translationese](http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03611). We preserved the same annotation style and included an ID and the EU state that each member of the European Parliament represents.\r\n- We hope this dataset will facilitate a unified comparative study of translations and language produced by highly fluent non-native speakers, two closely-related phenomena that have only been studied in isolation so far.\r\n- For updates, please check the [official repository](https://github.com/senisioi/enntt-release)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you use this work in your research, please cite:\r\n```\r\n@InProceedings{enntt-corpus,\r\n  author = {Sergiu Nisioi and Ella Rabinovich and Liviu P.
